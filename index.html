                    <p>
                        Glyphweaver is an action adventure game about discovering the secrets
                        of a lost civilization. Created in 30 days using Unreal Engine for the 2024 annual Github
                        Gameoff Game jam (November), I worked as the lead programmer amongst a small team.
                        My role was an important one here, as I guided other programmers when
                        they needed help or corrections, while designing and programming the
                        systems and frameworks required for this project. I designed the combat
                        system from the ground up, including a Doom-like token system to ensure
                        the player doesn't get overwhelmed or swarmed by enemies. I created unique
                        spells and utilized the Environment Query System to create complex AI
                        behavior with varying enemy types to keep combat challenging and interesting.
                        I challenged myself to work almost entirely in C++ and mostly accomplished that.
                        I also designed the UI and accompanying Save/Load system.
                        Please note that while the GitHub link below doesn't link to my personal
                        GitHub page, it is still the exact project I worked on minus the marketplace
                        assets we used to complete the project.

                    <h3>Clocktergeist</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clocktergeist is an FPS Boss Rush with a focus on combat that won Best Art Direction in the 2025 Boss Rush game jam.
                        Using Unreal Engine, I worked as a programmer and game designer, and was the designer responsible for most of the game's systems.
                        Because I was the most experienced with GAS, I had to create video tutorials and various in-engine showcases 
                        to allow the other team members to use the system properly, which helped solidify many of the GAS concepts for me. 
                        I designed and implemented the grappling hook system (among other things) over a few iterations, and used
                        a clever solution to handle moving grapple targets - homing projectiles. Unfortunately, I faced a health issue that caused
                        me to drop out for about 2 weeks in the middle of the jam, but I started and ended very strong by both providing the template and systems
                        necessary to complete the game at the start of the jam, and polishing/debugging the many loose ends at the jam's close. This game was a lot of fun to 
                        work on and was technically challenging. I have since used GAS in every project and have continued to improve my GAS workflow.

                <h3>Idiot Guardsmen</h3>
                <p>
                    A short, silly adventure game where you must guard a powerful, elite wizard as a complete idiot. This game was created
                    for Brackey's game jam in 2025 and uses Unreal Engine.
                    I was the sole developer on this game apart from Charles, the sound engineer who created the sounds and music.
                    The code was written mostly in C++ and is totally original, however the art and VFX are from the marketplace.
                    This project required me to create some robust systems that I didn't originally plan for, like the many
                    timers on the prisoner and the dialogue system for various guards, along with world space UI elements.

                <h3>Guardian of Gator Grove: The Final Stand</h3>
                <p>
                    Built upon my knowledge of past projects, this FPS Tower Defense
                    contains multiple enemy types, turret upgrades, player abilities,
                    a stunning environment, and everything else you'd expect from an
                    FPS tower defense game created with Unreal Engine. Made solo in 2 weeks for the Acerola Jam.
                    I wanted a unique enemy that would chase the player indefinitely,
                    and that meant I needed to figure out how to get AI to jump over
                    obstacles. Additionally, I spent the equivalent of 3 days
                    balancing every aspect of the game to give new and experienced
                    players a rewarding gameplay loop. I had to sacrifice other
                    mechanics like a final boss, extra abilities, different turret
                    projectiles, etc. just to get the balance right. Game
                    developers often find themselves in these balancing acts as
                    that's simply a part of the job.

                <h3>Untitled Zombie RPG</h3>
                <p>
                    I worked as the sole programmer on this Unreal Engine 5 untitled zombie game
                    with over 10 people. The design doc called for various systems like
                    a random quest generator, item pickups, a drag and drop inventory,
                    and randomized back-alley shops. The project was in development
                    for roughly 2 months before production stopped, but the work I
                    did with the team is worthy of showcasing. This project forced
                    me to learn lots of new things very quickly, like creating my
                    own ability system from scratch, complex maths, and creating
                    exciting, polished projectile weapon and melee weapon mechanics.

                            I continue learning new things about game development, enrolling in courses
                            from reputable developers, and trying to solve difficult programming
                            problems with a healthy dose of elbow grease.
