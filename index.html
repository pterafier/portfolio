                    <h3>Forgeborn</h3>
                    <p>
                        Forgeborn is a Blacksmith Simulator set in medieval times with custom art, custom sounds and music, and custom code. This game was created
                        in about a month for the 2025 "ThatGameCompany x Coreblazer" game jam.
                        I designed all the code in the game to be data driven and use excellent inheritence practices to minimize the amount of extra work
                        I would have to do throughout the project. The workstations are a great example of this; using inheritence made it easy to add entries to the action log, and play
                        sounds when items were completed. The quick time event minigames use timers and input checks to determine player success, and those events 
                        are also data driven and unique per-item, meaning that a Viridium Sword and an Iron Sword have different quick time events - a design decision
                        that allows players to become more immersed in the blacksmithing experience. While working on the camera system, I was surprised at how complex
                        it became due to the need to possess an invisible pawn and perform some interpolation when returning to the player-controlled camera, ensuring that
                        the camera returned to the correct location.

                    <h3>Glyphweaver</h3>
                    <p>
                        Glyphweaver is an action adventure game about discovering the secrets
                        of a lost civilization. Created in 30 days using Unreal Engine for the 2024 annual Github
                        Gameoff Game jam (November), I worked as the lead programmer amongst a small team.
                        My role was an important one here, as I guided other programmers when
                        they needed help or corrections, while designing and programming the
                        systems and frameworks required for this project. I designed the combat
                        system from the ground up, including a Doom-like token system to ensure
                        the player doesn't get overwhelmed or swarmed by enemies. I created unique
                        spells and utilized the Environment Query System to create complex AI
                        behavior with varying enemy types to keep combat challenging and interesting.
                        I challenged myself to work almost entirely in C++ and mostly accomplished that.
                        I also designed the UI and accompanying Save/Load system.
                        Please note that while the GitHub link below doesn't link to my personal
                        GitHub page, it is still the exact project I worked on minus the marketplace
                        assets we used to complete the project.

                    <h3>Clocktergeist</h3>
                    <p>
                        Clocktergeist is an FPS Boss Rush with a focus on combat that won Best Art Direction in the 2025 Boss Rush game jam.
                        Using Unreal Engine, I worked as a programmer and game designer, and was the designer responsible for most of the game's systems.
                        Because I was the most experienced with GAS, I had to create video tutorials and various in-engine showcases 
                        to allow the other team members to use the system properly, which helped solidify many of the GAS concepts for me. 
                        I designed and implemented the grappling hook system (among other things) over a few iterations, and used
                        a clever solution to handle moving grapple targets - homing projectiles. Unfortunately, I faced a health issue that caused
                        me to drop out for about 2 weeks in the middle of the jam, but I started and ended very strong by both providing the template and systems
                        necessary to complete the game at the start of the jam, and polishing/debugging the many loose ends at the jam's close. This game was a lot of fun to 
                        work on and was technically challenging. I have since used GAS in every project and have continued to improve my GAS workflow.

                <h3>Guardian of Gator Grove: The Final Stand</h3>
                <p>
                    Built upon my knowledge of past projects, this FPS Tower Defense
                    contains multiple enemy types, turret upgrades, player abilities,
                    a stunning environment, and everything else you'd expect from an
                    FPS tower defense game created with Unreal Engine. Made solo in 2 weeks for the Acerola Jam.
                    I wanted a unique enemy that would chase the player indefinitely,
                    and that meant I needed to figure out how to get AI to jump over
                    obstacles. Additionally, I spent the equivalent of 3 days
                    balancing every aspect of the game to give new and experienced
                    players a rewarding gameplay loop. I had to sacrifice other
                    mechanics like a final boss, extra abilities, different turret
                    projectiles, etc. just to get the balance right. Game
                    developers often find themselves in these balancing acts as
                    that's simply a part of the job.

                    While this project isn't in a state that's going to shock anyone visually, the systems in place are easily my best work.
                    Featuring a nice framework for saving and loading, a framework for menus and UI, clean GAS implementation, and a robust
                    interaction system all built from the ground up, I couldn't be more proud of the state of this project. If you're a 
                    recruiter or someone interested in checking out the details of this project, I made a snapshot of the project and its
                    code available on GitHub at the link below. This project also comes with detailed documentation about each of the 
                    implemented systems which is also linked below.

                            I'm a passionate, dedicated professional that loves programming and designing
                            games. From player movement, to fully networked and replicated game mechanics,
                            everything I do in (and out of) the engine I do with quality in mind. The only
                            thing that can match my passion for game development is my passion for learning.
                            I continue learning new things about game development, enrolling in courses
                            from reputable developers, and trying to solve difficult programming
                            problems with a healthy dose of elbow grease.
