                            <p>
                                A short survival game created in 10 days for the GoedWare game jam.
                                This was the 3rd jam I had participated in and is one of my proudest 
                                finished products. I created all the assets except for the fox, 
                                animations, and skybox. Anything not created by me was found in an
                                asset pack on the Unreal Engine marketplace. This is the most fun,
                                vibey game I've made to date and is worth the 10 minutes to play.

                            <h3>Guardian of Gator Grove: The Final Stand</h3>
                            <p>
                                Built upon my knowledge of past projects, this FPS Tower Defense
                                contains multiple enemy types, turret upgrades, player abilities,
                                a stunning environment, and everything else you'd expect from an
                                FPS tower defense game. Made solo in 2 weeks for the Acerola Jam.
                                I wanted a unique enemy that would chase the player indefinitely,
                                and that meant I needed to figure out how to get AI to jump over
                                obstacles. Additionally, I spent the equivalent of 3 days 
                                balancing every aspect of the game to give new and experienced
                                players a rewarding gameplay loop. I had to sacrifice other 
                                mechanics like a final boss, extra abilities, different turret
                                projectiles, etc. just to get the balance right. Game
                                developers often find themselves in these balancing acts as 
                                that's simply a part of the job.

                            <p>
                                I worked as the sole programmer on this untitled zombie game
                                with over 10 people. The design doc called for various systems like
                                a random quest generator, item pickups, a drag and drop inventory,
                                and randomized back-alley shops. The project was in development
                                for roughly 2 months before production stopped, but the work I
                                did with the team is worthy of showcasing. This project forced
                                me to learn lots of new things very quickly, like creating my
                                own ability system from scratch, complex maths, and creating 
                                exciting, polished projectile weapon and melee weapon mechanics.

                            <p>
                                The culmination of everything I've learned, Dungeonbound is an
                                intense, medieval-era dungeon crawler RPG combined with the most
                                enjoyable parts of cozy games like farming, relationships, and
                                clear progression. The project has been in development since
                                August of 2024, and because the early stages of development are
                                often the most exciting I decided to get the boring, complicated
                                stuff out of the way. As a result, there isn't much to show 
                                just yet, however because the project endured such a rigourous
                                design process, a gif of the design doc and task board are shown.
                                The project is networked through Steam - players can host their 
                                own servers and allow their friends to join by searching for the 
                                server name. Additionally, every mechanic that's been developed 
                                is fully replicated with server authority in mind. Dungeonbound 
                                is technically a solo project, however I've invited artists and 
                                programmers I've met from other game jams to work on the project 
                                at their leisure - they can come and go as they please, with the 
                                promise of revenue share at the end for those that contributed.

                        <p>
                            I'm a passionate, dedicated professional that loves programming and designing
                            games. From player movement, to fully networked and replicated game mechanics,
                            everything I do in (and out of) the engine I do with quality in mind. The only
                            thing that can match my passion for game development is my passion for learning.
                            I continue learning new things about game development, enrolling in courses
                            from reputable developers, and trying to solve difficult programming
                            problems with a healthy dose of elbow grease.
